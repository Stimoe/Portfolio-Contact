# Portfolio

This is my basic portfolio page to show off my projects.  It is 2 basic pages, mostly just html and css.

The about page gives some information about me as well as some different ways to contact me.

The portfolio page has some cards in it that give a brief title of the project as well as links to both the deployed versions as well as the github pages.
This page illustrates that I am competant in front end, though through my projects I show that I have more interest and skill on the back end as a developer.

The deployed site can be found here, https://stimoe.github.io/Thomas-Portfolio-Page/
